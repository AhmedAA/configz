Blind-Alien Theme for Awesome 3.4.10

INSTALLATION:

1. Copy the rc.lua to your awesome configuration folder, probably "~/.config/awesome/"

2. Copy the theme files and icon folders to "/usr/share/awesome/themes/blind-alien/"

3. If you want the MPD Play, Pause, Prev, Next buttons to force update the MPD widget after being pressed, copy launcher.lua to "/usr/share/awesome/lib/awful/widget/". If you don't want that you may have to disable these features in rc.lua.

4. If you want to be able to disable the application icons in your tasklist and align the tasklist_floating_icon icon on the left (next to the task-name) instead of on the right, then copy tasklist.lua to "/usr/share/awesome/lib/awful/widget/". If you don't want that you may have to disable these features in rc.lua.

5. Enable/Disable any widgets you like and modify their parameters in rc.lua beginning at line 25. (Don't forget to modify the wiboxes too!)
