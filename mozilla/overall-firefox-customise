FIRST: Go to about:config, look up browser.tabs.onTop, make it "false"
Copy the CSS in this folder into stylish, and enable (note this CSS only works
on linux, for windows search for Ahoka pastebin)
Move all add on buttons to the add on bar in the bottom.
Move the navigation bar to the left of the tabs bar (and all
navigation buttons).
Should be all set.

Alternatively, the navigation bar could be moved to the addons bar, but that
requires the addons bar to be visible most of the time. That might not be
desireable.
